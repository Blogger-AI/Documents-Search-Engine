# 📄 AI Document Search Engine

## 📌 Project Overview
This project is an AI-powered document search engine designed to retrieve accurate and relevant answers from a domain-specific PDF knowledge base. Unlike simple keyword search or RAG-based systems, this application uses semantic similarity, contextual extraction, and query-type awareness to deliver precise responses.

## ✨ Unique Features
- **Smart Question-Type Detection**
  - Identifies definition-based vs explanation-based queries
  - Dynamically adjusts answer extraction strategy
- **Context-Aware Answer Extraction**
  - Returns focused definitions or contextual explanations
- **Relevance Threshold Filtering**
  - Prevents incorrect or unrelated answers
- **Professional UI**
  - Built with Streamlit for clean and user-friendly interaction

> These features were not directly taught during the semester and demonstrate original system design.

## 🧠 Technologies Used
- Python
- Streamlit
- Scikit-learn (TF-IDF, Cosine Similarity)
- PyPDF2
- Docker (optional)
